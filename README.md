To create a Contact Management System in C that allows users to add & view contacts and exit the application, you can follow the structured approach outlined below. This guide includes essential keywords, data structures, and sample code snippets.

Overview

The Contact Management System will enable users to:
 Add New Contacts: Input details like name,phone number,email address.
 View Contacts: Display all stored contacts.
 Exit the Program: Cleanly terminate the application.

Essential Keywords

#include: To include standard libraries.
 .The #include <stdio.h> directive in C programming is crucial for enabling input and output operations.
 .The #include <string.h> directive in C is essential for utilizing a variety of string manipulation 
  functions provided by the C Standard Library.
struct: To define the structure for contacts.
printf, scanf: For input and output operations.
return: To exit from functions.

HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN THE PROGRAM

Instal C Compiler. Open the terminal. Navigate to your directory in Ubuntu, by typing 'nano filename.c' you are able to type in the code (any filename can be given; Eg: struct.c). Clone the code and Save the code by pressing CRTL X and Y. Compile it by using gcc.

Commands: 
• mkdir directoryname (any directory name) 
• cd dir-name (to access the directory) 
• nano filename.c (to open a file to save the code)

Compiling commands: 
• gcc filename.c 
• ./a.out
