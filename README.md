To create a Contact Management System in C that allows users to add and view contacts, you can follow the structured approach outlined below. This guide includes essential keywords, data structures, and sample code snippets.

HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN THE PROGRAM

Instal C Compiler. Open the terminal. Navigate to your directory in Ubuntu, by typing 'nano filename.c' you are able to type in the code (any filename can be given; Eg: struct.c). Clone the code and Save the code by pressing CRTL X and Y. Compile it by using gcc.

Commands: 
• mkdir directoryname (any directory name) 
• cd dir-name (to access the directory) 
• nano filename.c (to open a file to save the code)

Compiling commands: 
• gcc filename.c
